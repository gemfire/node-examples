# Tanzu GemFire Node.js Examples
 
The examples in this repository show how to use the [Node.js Client for VMware Tanzu GemFire](https://github.com/gemfire/gemfire-node-client) API to build client applications.

Each example is contained in its own subdirectory, with an explanatory README file.

All of the examples show how to build and run a Node.js app using a local Tanzu GemFire cluster. Two of the examples (`book-service` and `nextjs-page-counter`) also illustrate how to build and run a Node.js app using a Tanzu GemFire for VMs service instance.

For further information, see the [Node.js Client for VMware Tanzu GemFire Documentation](http://gemfire-nodeclient.docs.pivotal.io/2-0/about-client-users-guide.html).
